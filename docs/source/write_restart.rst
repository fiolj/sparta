************
Description:
************

Write a binary restart file with the current state of the simulation.

During a long simulation, the :ref:`restart<restart>` command can be
used to output restart files periodically.  The write_restart command
is useful at the end of a run or between two runs, whenever you wish
to write out a single current restart file.

Similar to :ref:`dump<dump>` files, the restart filename can contain
two wild-card characters.  If a "\*" appears in the filename, it is
replaced with the current timestep value.  If a "%" character appears
in the filename, then one file is written by each processor and the
"%" character is replaced with the processor ID from 0 to P-1.  An
additional file with the "%" replaced by "base" is also written, which
contains global information.  For example, the files written for
filename restart.% would be restart.base, restart.0, restart.1, ...
restart.P-1.  This creates smaller files and can be a fast mode of
output and subsequent input on parallel machines that support parallel
I/O.  The optional *fileper* and *nfile* keywords discussed below can
alter the number of files written.

Restart files can be read by a :ref:`read_restart<read-restart>`
command to restart a simulation from a particular state.  Because the
file is binary, it may not be readable on another machine.

.. important::

  Although the purpose of restart files is to enable
  restarting a simulation from where it left off, not all information
  about a simulation is stored in the file.  For example, the list of
  fixes that were specified during the initial run is not stored, which
  means the new input script must specify any fixes you want to use.
  See the :ref:`read_restart<read-restart>` command for details about
  what is stored in a restart file.

The optional *nfile* or *fileper* keywords can be used in conjunction
with the "%" wildcard character in the specified restart file name.
As explained above, the "%" character causes the restart file to be
written in pieces, one piece for each of P processors.  By default P =
the number of processors the simulation is running on.  The *nfile* or
*fileper* keyword can be used to set P to a smaller value, which can
be more efficient when running on a large number of processors.

The *nfile* keyword sets P to the specified Nf value.  For example, if
Nf = 4, and the simulation is running on 100 processors, 4 files will
be written, by processors 0,25,50,75.  Each will collect information
from itself and the next 24 processors and write it to a restart file.

For the *fileper* keyword, the specified value of Np means write one
file for every Np processors.  For example, if Np = 4, every 4th
processor (0,4,8,12,etc) will collect information from itself and the
next 3 processors and write it to a restart file.
