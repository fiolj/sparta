The `developers wish list link <http://sparta.sandia.gov/future.html>`__" on the SPARTA web page
gives a list of features we are planning to add to SPARTA in the
future. Please contact the you are interested in contributing to the
those developments or would be a future user of that feature.

You can also send `email to the developers <http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html>`__ if you want to add your
wish to the list.

Sandia's predecessor to SPARTA is a DSMC code called ICARUS. It was
developed in the early 1990s by Tim Bartel and `Steve Plimpton <http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp>`__. It was later modified and
extended by Michael Gallis.

ICARUS is a 2d code, written in Fortran, which models the flow
geometry around bodies with a collection of adjoining body-fitted grid
blocks.  The geometry of the grid cells within in a single block is
represented with analytic equations, which allows for fast particle
tracking.

Some details about ICARUS, including simulation snapshots and papers,
are discussed on `this page <http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/dsmc.html>`__

Performance-wise ICARUS scaled quite well on several generations of
parallel machines, and is still used by Sandia researchers
today. ICARUS was export-controlled software, and so was not
distributed widely outside of Sandia.

SPARTA development began in late 2011. In contrast to ICARUS, it is a
3d code, written in C++, and uses a hierarchical Cartesian grid to
track particles. Surfaces are embedded in the grid, which cuts and
splits their flow volumes.

The `Authors link <http://sparta.sandia.gov/history.html>`__ on the
SPARTA web page gives a timeline of features added to the code since
its initial open-source release.
