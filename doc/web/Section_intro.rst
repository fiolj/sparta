**************
What is SPARTA
**************

SPARTA is a Direct Simulation Montel Carlo code that models rarefied
gases, using collision, chemistry, and boundary condition models. It
uses a hierarchical Cartesian grid to track and group particles for 3d
or 2d or axisymmetric models. Objects emedded in the gas are represented
as triangulated surfaces and cut through grid cells.

For examples of SPARTA simulations, see the `SPARTA WWW
Site <http://sparta.sandia.gov>`__.

SPARTA runs efficiently on single-processor desktop or laptop machines,
but is designed for parallel computers. It will run on any parallel
machine that compiles C++ and supports the
`MPI <http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi>`__ message-passing library. This
includes distributed- or shared-memory parallel machines as well as
commodity clusters.

SPARTA can model systems with only a few particles up to millions or
billions. See :ref:`performance` for information on
SPARTA performance and scalability, or the Benchmarks section of the
`SPARTA WWW Site <http://sparta.sandia.gov>`__.

SPARTA is a freely-available open-source code, distributed under the
terms of the `GNU Public
License <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`__, or sometimes by
request under the terms of the `GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL) <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>`__, which means you can use or modify the code however you wish. The only restrictions imposed by the GPL or LGPL are on how you distribute the code further. See :ref:`open-source` below for a
brief discussion of the open-source philosophy.

SPARTA is designed to be easy to modify or extend with new capabilities,
such as new collision or chemistry models, boundary conditions, or
diagnostics. See :ref:`Section 10 <modify>` for more details.

SPARTA is written in C++ which is used at a hi-level to structure the
code and its options in an object-oriented fashion. The kernel
computations use simple data structures and C-like code for effciency.
So SPARTA is really written in an object-oriented C style.

SPARTA was developed with internal funding at `Sandia National
Laboratories <http://www.sandia.gov>`__, a US Department of Energy lab.
See `Section 1.5 <acknowledgements>` below for more information on SPARTA
funding and individuals who have contributed to SPARTA.

SPARTA features
***************

This section highlights SPARTA features, with links to specific commands
which give more details. The `next section <grids>` illustrates the
kinds of grid geometries and surface definitions which SPARTA supports.

If SPARTA doesn't have your favorite collision model, boundary
condition, or diagnostic, see `Section 10 <modify>` of
the manual, which describes how it can be added to SPARTA.

   `Pizza.py <http://pizza.sandia.gov>`__ which provides tools for doing
   setup, analysis, plotting, and visualization for SPARTA simulations.
   Pizza.py is written in `Python <http://www.python.org>`__ and is
   available for download from `the Pizza.py WWW site <http://pizza.sandia.gov>`__.

.. _grids:

****************************
Grids and surfaces in SPARTA
****************************

SPARTA overlays a grid over the simulation domain which is used to track
particles and to co-locate particles in the same grid cell for
performing collision and chemistry operations. SPARTA uses a Cartesian
hierarchical grid. Cartesian means that the faces of a grid cell are
aligned with the Cartesian xyz axes. Hierarchical means that individual
grid cells can be sub-divided into smaller cells, recursively. This
allows for flexible grid cell refinement in any region of the simulation
domain. E.g. around a surface, or in a high-density region of the gas
flow.

An example 2d hierarchical grid is shown in the diagram, for a circular
surface object (in red) with the grid refined on the upwind side of the
object (flow from left to right).

|image0|

Objects represented with a surface triangulation (line segments in 2d)
can also be read in to define objects which particles flow around.
Individual surface elements are assigned to grid cells they intersect
with, so that particle/surface collisions can be efficiently computed.

As an example, here is coarsely triangulated representation of the space
shuttle (only 616 triangles!), which could be embedded in a simulation
box. Click on the image for a larger picture.

See :ref:`howto-grids` and :ref:`howto-surfaces` for more details of both the grids and surface objects that SPARTA supports and how to define them.

.. _open-source:

************************
Open source distribution
************************

SPARTA comes with no warranty of any kind. As each source file states in
its header, it is a copyrighted code that is distributed free-of-
charge, under the terms of the `GNU Public
License <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>`__ (GPL). This is often
referred to as open-source distribution - see
`www.gnu.org <http://www.gnu.org>`__ or
`www.opensource.org <http://www.opensource.org>`__ for more details. The
legal text of the GPL is in the LICENSE file that is included in the
SPARTA distribution.

Here is a summary of what the GPL means for SPARTA users:

(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend SPARTA in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.

(2) If you distribute a modified version of SPARTA, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL. You
should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of SPARTA.

(3) If you release any code that includes SPARTA source code, then it
must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the terms of
the GPL.

(4) If you give SPARTA files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file and
source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices) should
remain part of the code.

In the spirit of an open-source code, these are various ways you can
contribute to making SPARTA better. You can send email to the
`developers <http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html>`__ on any of these
topics.

-  Point prospective users to the `SPARTA WWW
   Site <http://sparta.sandia.gov>`__. Mention it in talks or link to it
   from your WWW site.
-  If you find an error or omission in this manual or on the `SPARTA WWW
   Site <http://sparta.sandia.gov>`__, or have a suggestion for
   something to clarify or include, send an email to the
   `developers <http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html>`__.
-  If you find a bug, :ref:`error-common` describes how to report it.
-  If you publish a paper using SPARTA results, send the citation (and
   any cool pictures or movies) to add to the Publications, Pictures,
   and Movies pages of the `SPARTA WWW
   Site <http://sparta.sandia.gov>`__, with links and attributions back
   to you.
-  The tools sub-directory of the SPARTA distribution has various
   stand-alone codes for pre- and post-processing of SPARTA data. More
   details are given in :ref:`tools`. If you write
   a new tool that others will find useful, it can be added to the
   SPARTA distribution.
-  SPARTA is designed to be easy to extend with new code for features
   like boundary conditions, collision or chemistry models, diagnostic
   computations, etc. :ref:`modify`  of the manual
   gives details. If you add a feature of general interest, it can be
   added to the SPARTA distribution.
-  The Benchmark page of the `SPARTA WWW
   Site <http://sparta.sandia.gov>`__ lists SPARTA performance on
   various platforms. The files needed to run the benchmarks are part of
   the SPARTA distribution. If your machine is sufficiently different
   from those listed, your timing data can be added to the page.
-  Cash. Small denominations, unmarked bills preferred. Paper sack OK.
   Leave on desk. VISA also accepted. Chocolate chip cookies encouraged.
