Common problems
***************

If two SPARTA runs do not produce the same answer on different machines or different numbers of processors, this is typically not a bug. On different machines, there can be numerical round-off in the computations which causes slight differences in particle trajectories or the number of particles, which will lead to numerical divergence of the particle trajectores and averaged statistical quantities within a few 100s or few 1000s of timesteps. When running on different numbers of processors, random numbers are used in different ways, so two simulations can be immediately different.
However, the statistical properties (e.g. overall particle temperature or per grid cell temperature or surface energy flux) for the two runs on different machines or on different numbers of processors should still be similar.

A SPARTA simulation typically has two stages, setup and run. Most SPARTA errors are detected at setup time; others like running out of memory may not occur until the middle of a run.

SPARTA tries to flag errors and print informative error messages so you can fix the problem. Of course, SPARTA cannot figure out physics or numerical mistakes, like choosing too big a timestep or specifying erroneous collision parameters. If you run into errors that SPARTA doesn't catch that you think it should flag, please send an email to the `developers <http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html>`__.

If you get an error message about an invalid command in your input script, you can determine what command is causing the problem by looking in the log.sparta file, or using the :ref:`command-echo` in your script or "-echo screen" as a :ref:`command-line argument <start-command-line-options>` to see it on the screen.
For a given command, SPARTA expects certain arguments in a specified order. If you mess this up, SPARTA will often flag the error, but it may read a bogus argument and assign a value that is valid, but not what you wanted.

Generally, SPARTA will print a message to the screen and logfile and exit gracefully when it encounters a fatal error. Sometimes it will print a WARNING to the screen and logfile and continue on; you can decide if the WARNING is important or not. A WARNING message that is generated in the middle of a run is only printed to the screen, not to the logfile, to avoid cluttering up statistical output. If SPARTA crashes or hangs without spitting out an error message first then it could be a bug (see the :ref:`next section <errors-reporting>`) or one of the following cases:

SPARTA runs in the available memory a processor allows to be allocated.  Most reasonable runs are compute limited, not memory limited, so this shouldn't be a bottleneck on most platforms. Almost all large memory allocations in the code are done via C-style malloc's which will generate an error message if you run out of memory. Smaller chunks of memory are allocated via C++ "new" statements. If you are unlucky, you could run out of memory just when one of these small requests is made, in which case the code will crash or hang (in parallel), since SPARTA doesn't trap on those errors.

Illegal arithmetic can cause SPARTA to run slow or crash. This is typically due to invalid physics and numerics that your simulation is computing. If you see wild statistical values or NaN values in your SPARTA output, something is wrong with your simulation. If you suspect this is happening, it is a good idea to print out statistical info frequently (e.g. every timestep) via the :ref:`command-stats` so you can monitor what is happening. Visualizing the particle motion is also a good idea to insure your model is behaving as you expect.

In parallel, one way SPARTA can hang is due to how different MPI implementations handle buffering of messages. If the code hangs without an error message, it may be that you need to specify an MPI setting or two (usually via an environment variable) to enable buffering or boost the sizes of messages that can be buffered.


.. _errors-reporting:

**************
Reporting bugs
**************

If you are confident that you have found a bug in SPARTA, please follow these steps.

Check the `New features and bug fixes <http://sparta.sandia.gov/bug.html>`__ section of the `SPARTA web site <http://sparta.sandia.gov>`__ to see if the bug has already been fixed.

If not, please email a description of the problem to the `developers <http://sparta.sandia.gov/authors.html>`__.

The most useful thing you can do to help us fix the bug is to isolate the problem. Run it on the smallest number of particles and grid cells and fewest number of processors and with the simplest and quick-to-run input script that reproduces the bug. And try to identify what command or combination of commands is causing the problem.

Error & warning messages
************************

These are two alphabetic lists of the :ref:`errors-list` and
:ref:`errors-warnings` messages SPARTA prints out and the reason why. If
the explanation here is not sufficient, the documentation for the
offending command may help. Error and warning messages also list the
source file and line number where the error was generated. For example,
this message

ERROR: Illegal create_particles command (create_particles.cpp:68)

means that line #68 in the file src/create_particles.cpp generated the
error. Looking in the source code may help you figure out what went
wrong.

   sense in between runs.
*Vertex contains duplicate edge*
   This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
   surface elements. It should not normally occur. Please report the
   issue to the SPARTA developers.
*Vertex contains edge that doesn't point to it*
   This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
   surface elements. It should not normally occur. Please report the
   issue to the SPARTA developers.
*Vertex contains invalid edge*
   This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
   surface elements. It should not normally occur. Please report the
   issue to the SPARTA developers.
*Vertex has less than 3 edges*
   This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
   surface elements. It should not normally occur. Please report the
   issue to the SPARTA developers.
*Vertex pointers to last edge are invalid*
   This is an error when calculating how a 3d grid is cut or split by
   surface elements. It should not normally occur. Please report the
   issue to the SPARTA developers.
*World variable count doesn't match # of partitions*
   A world-style variable must specify a number of values equal to the
   number of processor partitions.
*Y cannot be periodic for axi-symmetric*
   Self-explanatory. See the boundary doc page for more details.
*Z dimension must be periodic for 2d simulation*
   Self-explanatory.

.. _errors-warnings:

Warnings
========

*%d particles were in wrong cells on timestep %ld*
   This is the total number of particles that are incorrectly matched to
   their grid cell.
*Grid cell interior corner points marked as unknown = %d*
   Corner points of grid cells interior to the simulation domain were
   not all marked successfully as inside, outside, or overlapping with
   surface elements. This should normally not happen, but does not
   affect simulations.
*More than one compute ke/particle*
   This may be inefficient since each such compute stores a vector of
   length equal to the number of particles.
*Restart file used different # of processors*
   The restart file was written out by a SPARTA simulation running on a
   different number of processors. This means you will likely want to
   re-balance the grid cells and particles across processors. This can
   be done using the balance or fix balance commands.
*Surface check found %d nearly infinitely thin line pairs*
   Two adjacent lines have normals in nearly opposite directions
   indicating the lines nearly overlay each other.
*Surface check found %d nearly infinitely thin triangle pairs*
   Two adjacent triangles have normals in nearly opposite directions
   indicating the triangles nearly overlay each other.
*Surface check found %d points nearly on lines*
   One or more points are nearly on a line they are not an end point of,
   which indicates an ill-formed surface.
*Surface check found %d points nearly on triangles*
   One or more points are nearly on a triangle they are not an end point
   of, which indicates an ill-formed surface.
