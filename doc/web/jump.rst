jump command
############


**Syntax:**

::

   jump file label 

-  file = filename of new input script to switch to
-  label = optional label within file to jump to

**Examples:**

::

   jump newfile
   jump in.run2 runloop
   jump SELF runloop 

**Description:**

This command closes the current input script file, opens the file with
the specified name, and begins reading SPARTA commands from that file.
Unlike the :ref:`include<command-include>` command, the original file is not
returned to, although by using multiple jump commands it is possible to
chain from file to file or back to the original file.

If the word "SELF" is used for the filename, then the current input
script is re-opened and read again.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The SELF option is not guaranteed to work when the
current input script is being read through stdin (standard input), e.g.

::

   spa_g++ < in.script 

since the SELF option invokes the C-library rewind() call, which may not
be supported for stdin on some systems or by some MPI implementations.
This can be worked around by using the :ref:`-in command-line argument<start-command-line-options>`, e.g.

::

   spa_g++ -in in.script 

or by using the :ref:`-var command-line argument<start-command-line-options>` to pass the script name as a
variable to the input script. In the latter case, a
:ref:`variable<command-variable>` called "fname" could be used in place of
SELF, e.g.

::

   spa_g++ -var fname in.script < in.script 

The 2nd argument to the jump command is optional. If specified, it is
treated as a label and the new file is scanned (without executing
commands) until the label is found, and commands are executed from that
point forward. This can be used to loop over a portion of the input
script, as in this example. These commands perform 10 runs, each of
10000 steps, and create 10 dump files named file.1, file.2, etc. The
:ref:`next<command-next>` command is used to exit the loop after 10
iterations. When the "a" variable has been incremented for the tenth
time, it will cause the next jump command to be skipped.

::

   variable a loop 10
   label loop
   dump 1 grid all 100 file.$a
   run 10000
   undump 1
   next a
   jump in.flow loop 

If the jump *file* argument is a variable, the jump command can be used
to cause different processor partitions to run different input scripts.
In this example, SPARTA is run on 40 processors, with 4 partitions of 10
procs each. An in.file containing the example variable and jump command
will cause each partition to run a different simulation.

::

   mpirun -np 40 lmp_ibm -partition 4x10 -in in.file 

::

   variable f world script.1 script.2 script.3 script.4
   jump $f 

Here is an example of a double loop which uses the :ref:`if<command-if>` and
jump commands to break out of the inner loop when a condition is met,
then continues iterating thru the outer loop.

::

   label      loopa
   variable    a loop 5
     label     loopb
     variable  b loop 5
     print     "A,B = $a,$b"
     run       10000
     if        $b > 2 then "jump in.script break"
     next      b
     jump      in.script loopb
   label       break
   variable    b delete 

::

   next       a
   jump        in.script loopa 

**Restrictions:**

If you jump to a file and it does not contain the specified label,
SPARTA will come to the end of the file and exit.

**Related commands:**

:ref:`command-variable`,
:ref:`command-include`,
:ref:`command-label`,
:ref:`command-next`

**Default:** none
