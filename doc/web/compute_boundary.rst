Description:
************

Define a computation that calculates one or more values for each
boundary (i.e. face) of the simulation box, based on the particles that
cross or collide with the boundary. The values are summed for each group
of species in the specified mixture. See the :ref:`mixture<command-mixture>`
command for how a set of species can be partitioned into groups.

Note that depending on the settings for the :ref:`boundary<command-boundary>`
command, when a particle collides with a boundary, it can exit the
simulation box (outflow), re-enter from the other side (periodic),
reflect specularly from the boundary, or interact with it as if it were
a surface. In the surface case, the incident particle may bounce off
(possibly as a different species), be captured by the boundary (vanish),
or a 2nd particle can also be emitted. The formulas below account for
all these possible scenarios. As an example, the pressure exerted on an
outflow boundary versus a specularly reflecting boundary is different,
since in the former case there is no net momentum flux back into the
simulation box by reflected particles.

Also note that all values for a boundary collision are tallied based on
the species group of the incident particle. Quantities associated with
outgoing particles are part of the same tally, even if they are in
different species groups.

The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways. The values for a single timestep can be output by the
:ref:`stats_style<command-stats-style>` command.

The values over many sampling timesteps can be averaged by the :ref:`fix ave/time<command-fix-ave-time>` command. It does its averaging as if the
particles striking the boundary at each sampling timestep were combined
together into one large set to compute the formulas below. The answer is
then divided by the number of sampling timesteps if it is not otherwise
normalized by the number of particles. Note that in general this is a
different normalization than taking the values produced by the formulas
below for a single timestep, summing them over the sampling timesteps,
and then dividing by the number of sampling steps. However for the
current values listed below, the two normalization methods are the same.

.. note:: If particle weighting is enabled via the :ref:`global weight<command-global>` command, then all of the values below are scaled by the weight assigned to the grid cell in which the particle collision with the boundary occurs. The only exception is the the *n* value, which is NOT scaled by the weight; it is a simple count of particle crossings or collisions with the boundary.

--------------

The *n* value counts the number of particles in the group crossing or
colliding with the boundary.

The *nwt* value counts the number of particles in the group crossing or
colliding with the boundary and weights the count by the weight assigned
to the grid cell in which the particle collision with the boundary
occurs. The *nwt* quantity will only be different than *n* if particle
weighting is enabled via the :ref:`global weight<command-global>` command.

The *mflux* value calculates the mass flux imparted to the boundary by
particles in the group. This is computed as

::

   Mflux = Sum_i (mass_i) / (A * dt / fnum) 

where the sum is over all contributing particle masses, normalized by A
= the area of the surface element, dt = the timestep, and fnum = the
real/simulated particle ratio set by the :ref:`global fnum<command-global>`
command.

The *press* value calculates the pressure *P* exerted on the boundary in
the normal direction by particles in the group, such that outward
pressure is positive. This is computed as

::

   p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
   P = Sum_i (p_delta_i dot N) / (A * dt / fnum) 

where A, dt, fnum are defined as before. P_delta is the change in
momentum of a particle, whose velocity changes from V_pre to V_post when
colliding with the boundary. The pressure exerted on the boundary is the
sum over all contributing p_delta dotted into the normal N of the
boundary which is directed into the box, normalized by A = the area of
the boundary face and dt = the timestep and fnum = the real/simulated
particle ratio set by the :ref:`global fnum<command-global>` command.

The *shx*, *shy*, *shz* values calculate the shear pressure components
Sx, Sy, Sz extered on the boundary in the tangential direction to its
normal by particles in the group, with respect to the x, y, z coordinate
axes. These are computed as

::

   p_delta = mass * (V_post - V_pre)
   p_delta_t = p_delta - (p_delta dot N) N
   Sx = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_x) / (A * dt / fnum)
   Sy = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_y) / (A * dt / fnum)
   Sz = - Sum_i (p_delta_t_z) / (A * dt / fnum) 

where p_delta, V_pre, V_post, N, A, dt, and fnum are defined as before.
P_delta_t is the tangential component of the change in momentum vector
p_delta of a particle. P_delta_t_x (and y,z) are its x, y, z components.

The *ke* value calculates the kinetic energy flux *Eflux* imparted to
the boundary by particles in the group, such that energy lost by a
particle is a positive flux. This is computed as

::

   e_delta = 1/2 mass (V_post^2 - V_pre^2)
   Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt / fnum) 

where e_delta is the kinetic energy change in a particle, whose velocity
changes from V_pre to V_post when colliding with the boundary. The
energy flux imparted to the boundary is the sum over all contributing
e_delta, normalized by A = the area of the boundary face and dt = the
timestep and fnum = the real/simulated particle ratio set by the :ref:`global fnum<command-global>` command.

The *erot* value calculates the rotational energy flux *Eflux* imparted
to the boundary by particles in the group, such that energy lost by a
particle is a positive flux. This is computed as

::

   e_delta = Erot_post - Erot_pre
   Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt / fnum) 

where e_delta is the rotational energy change in a particle, whose
internal rotational energy changes from Erot_pre to Erot_post when
colliding with the boundary. The flux equation is the same as for the
*ke* value.

The *evib* value calculates the vibrational energy flux *Eflux* imparted
to the boundary by particles in the group, such that energy lost by a
particle is a positive flux. This is computed as

::

   e_delta = Evib_post - Evib_pre
   Eflux = - Sum_i (e_delta) / (A * dt / fnum) 

where e_delta is the vibrational energy change in a particle, whose
internal vibrational energy changes from Evib_pre to Evib_post when
colliding with the boundary. The flux equation is the same as for the
*ke* value.

The *etot* value calculates the total energy flux imparted to the
boundary by particles in the group, such that energy lost by a particle
is a positive flux. This is simply the sum of kinetic, rotational, and
vibrational energies. Thus the total energy flux is the sum of what is
computed by the *ke*, *erot*, and *evib* values.

**Output info:**

This compute calculates a global array, with the number of columns equal
to the number of values times the number of groups. The ordering of
columns is first by values, then by groups. I.e. if the *n* and *u*
values were specified as keywords, then the first two columns would be
*n* and *u* for the first group, the 3rd and 4th columns would be *n*
and *u* for the second group, etc. The number of rows is 4 for a 2d
simulation for the 4 faces (xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi), and it is 6 for a 3d
simulation (xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi, zlo, zhi).

The array can be accessed by any command that uses global array values
from a compute as input. See :ref:`Section 6.4<howto-output>` for an overview of SPARTA output
options.

The array values will be in the :ref:`units<command-units>` appropriate to
the individual values as described above. *N* is unitless. *Press*,
*shx*, *shy*, *shz* are in pressure units. *Ke*, *erot*, *evib*, and
*etot* are in energy/area-time units for 3d simulations and
energy/length-time units for 2d simulations.

--------------

Styles with a *kk* suffix are functionally the same as the corresponding
style without the suffix. They have been optimized to run faster,
depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the :ref:`Accelerating SPARTA<accelerate>` section of the manual. The
accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the same
results, except for different random number, round-off and precision
issues.

These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package. See the :ref:`Making SPARTA<start-making-sparta>` section for more info.

You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the :ref:`-suffix command-line switch<start-command-line-options>` when you invoke SPARTA, or you
can use the :ref:`suffix<command-suffix>` command in your input script.

See the :ref:`Accelerating SPARTA<accelerate>` section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.
